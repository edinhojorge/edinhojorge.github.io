# Long Answer

My name is Eder and I love technology, and have a special passion for code. Maybe I was born talented for that, or maybe I just like it so much that I became talented doing that. It is a happy dilemma.

I have to tell you that a game is to blame about my decision to become a professional in IT area. I was 13 years old when my father got our first computer, and I loved it, using every program, doing a lot of stuffs and crashing it many times. It was fun, and I use to spent hours playing solitary sometimes, helping my father on his business, typing documents, or even arranging icons on screen, using defrag… but then someone gave me a specific game called Warcraft. That was fun, and I played a lot, even next versions, and today it is a big company and great game, and that made me realise that I wanted to join a IT course, and build games. That were my first big goal in life I think, so many years ago, but I still remember telling my friends why I wanted to join IT course at high school.

I got the IT course for High School, and it was very good. I have made some games, but just for fun. Didn’t know anything about maths involved to build a good game, but I did with what I had. While I was studying, I started a project build a search site in Perl, in 1998. The internet was growing and I started to learn from others, researching about everything. I have done a Perl search using text files as database, because I didn’t know that Database exist, lol. I was about to get that discipline in the next semester. I didn’t finish the entire site, but I remember explaining my dad about what I was building. At that time, we had a brazilian search engine and Yahoo as the most popular ones. I wanted to start with a local search engine, asking business owners to get into the system and sell my services to build their websites. That was something interesting, but then I got hired for a internship at school.

Thinking about it later, I think it was a bad decision, because I had my parents support to start and keep going with my own business. Along with some others bad decisions at that time, that at least made me a experienced person I believe. I know it was a bad decision, but at the same time, I have grown a lot working for the school.

Well, the year is 1999 and 2000 when I did my internship. I was still learning some disciplines at school, and I could apply many of what I was learning there. I started working with a Client Server language called SQLWindows that later become Team Developer. My Client Server experience at that time was with Visual Basic, so I was happy to work with SQLWindows. I had my first contact with Classes and Inheritance that will be important for my history. The bad part was that I spent months studying the Web, and I couldn’t start at the Web team. Well, I rebuilt the entire school management system, and many of the official documents I have from school were crafted by me. That was and still is a great honour to me. When then internship was over, I stayed there for another 4 months and got a new job.

In my new job, I started as a Java programmer. I didn’t know a bit of Java, just had seen something at school with applets. Not a issue right? I am a fast learner, and I could learn a new language in a matter of a week or two. Big issue, Java was a complete new world, and complete different. A little hard to understand at first look, and even harder to change from a procedural or event understanding to a object oriented language. But then God sent my pair mate that knew a little more and I could have a mentor for a while. As I was working and learning Java, I realized that Java was the most powerful language I had ever knew, and guess what, I am with Java for more than 17 years, and the language keep growing, and bringing more challenges that I love to face.

I don’t know about you, but I know two important things today. First one it that the Java world is wonderful and I love it. The second one is that I love to teach, or give good explanations about something that is related to Java or Technology or Architecture. It wasn’t so clear to me as it is now, and the best part of that is that this make me feel alive, challenged and motivated everyday. The only thing that I need to do is those things, no matter how.

During all those years, a lot of technologies come and go, and with all that, I always kept Java by my side, and I always teach any person that asks for help, just because it is what I love, it is what I was made for, my purpose in life. Of course I have other things that I care, like my family and friends, my health, etc, but this about me is more from the professional point of view.

That is part of my history, and part of me, at least how everything started. I appreciate that you have read until here, and I encourage you to learn more about technology and Java, you won’t regret.
